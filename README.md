# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic Tac Toe in Python.
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe in Python! This project is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in Python.


Description:

This Python script allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe against each other. Players take turns entering their moves (either 'X' or 'O') by selecting a number corresponding to an empty cell on the game board. The game checks for winning conditions after each move, including diagonal, row, and column checks. The game ends when one player wins or when all cells are filled, resulting in a draw.
